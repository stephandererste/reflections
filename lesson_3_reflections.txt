When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--when i need to access the content from multiple computers
--when i'm collaborating with others


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--to avoid conflicts when multiple users are working on the same file
--don't want my local changes to be undone by syncing
